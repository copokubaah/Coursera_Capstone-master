# Finding Similar Neighbourds between Two Big Cities: Toronto, ON and Queens, New York
## An Unsupervised Machine Learning Approach

### Project Summary:
The world has become one giant global village and thus, each and every minute, people travel from one 
place to another eiher temporary or for permanent stay. When people are making such life-transition moves, they want to find or live in places that embrace similar culture (e.g. food, clothing, language etc.) as their present location. Finding a place that share similar venue as your current neighborhood can be burdensome considering 
how developed most cities in the world are currently. Hence, this project aimed to find neighborhoods between two big cities namely Toronto, ON and Queens, New York that are similar with respect to venues. To do this, I employed machine learning approaches and other techniques to segment and cluster neighborhoods in these two big cities. We employed web scraping and API interaction approaches to get data and python libraries to clean and explore the data. We used Folium Maps to view the neighborhood data and employed Clustering approach to find neighborhoods that are similar. Our results showed that Toronto and Queens had neighborhoods that shared similar characteristics in 6 out of 9 clusters studied. This project 
showed that clustering models and location data can be used to determine places that share similar venue 
categories. This will be useful for people who are moving from one place to another and wanting either 
something similar to or different from their previous locations.
